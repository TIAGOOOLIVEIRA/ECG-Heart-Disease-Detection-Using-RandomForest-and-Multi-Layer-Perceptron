# ECG Heart Disease Detection Using RandomForest and Multi Layer Perceptron

This project is built and maintained by Tiago Oliveira - [ti.olive@gmail.com](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tiagoliveira/).

This work was made based on the [Physionet ECG Challenge 2017 dataset](https://physionet.org/challenge/2017/)

It was the project I started at [Data Science Retreat](https://datascienceretreat.com/) in 2018/Berlin 

The [WaveForm DataBase library](https://physionet.org/physiotools/wfdb.shtml) has helped a lot for extracting the properties from the dataset records
